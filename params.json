It uses a filmstrip image [i.e. each frame after each other in a long horizontal line, left to right] and the css background-position property. It is straightforward to use but in this version 0.9 tailored to what I needed, however it should be clear how to extend it to work for your needs.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe example.html should be relatively explanatory, however check the following:\r\n\r\n* include jquery\r\n* make sure the target div has a set height and width\r\n* edit the default options in the plugin to set your required frames-per-second and width of frame\r\n* make sure to include a html data value in your target div for the number of frames. e.g. data-frames=\"15\"\r\n* if you are passing options [fps/width] into the plugin the arg needs to be set to 'play' or 'stop'\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCool. This is still a slightly raw plugin so any feedback or improvements would be much appreciated. :}\r\n\r\n\r\nLicence\r\n-------\r\n\r\nCopyright 2013 Patrick Best\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
